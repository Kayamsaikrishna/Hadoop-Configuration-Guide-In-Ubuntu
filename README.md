# Hadoop Configuration Guide on Ubuntu

This repository provides a comprehensive guide for installing and configuring Hadoop 3.4.0 on Ubuntu, ensuring you have a solid understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical implementation.

## Introduction to Hadoop

Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets using the MapReduce programming model. It is designed to scale out from a single server to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.

### Key Components of Hadoop:

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** 
   - HDFS is the primary storage system used by Hadoop applications.
   - It provides high throughput access to application data and is designed to handle large amounts of data across many machines.

2. **MapReduce:**
   - MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.
   - It divides the task into smaller sub-tasks (map), processes them in parallel, and then combines (reduce) the results.

3. **YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):**
   - YARN is the resource management layer of Hadoop that manages and schedules the resources for the running applications.
   - It allows multiple data processing engines like graph processing, interactive processing, stream processing, and batch processing to run and manage resources within a single cluster.

4. **Hadoop Common:**
   - Hadoop Common provides the shared utilities and libraries that support the other Hadoop modules.
   - It includes the necessary Java files and scripts required to start Hadoop.

### Why Use Hadoop?

- **Scalability:** Hadoop is designed to scale horizontally by adding more servers to the cluster.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Hadoop automatically replicates data across multiple nodes, ensuring that data is protected even if hardware fails.
- **Cost-Effective:** Hadoop runs on a cluster of commodity hardware, making it more affordable than traditional high-end servers.
- **Flexibility:** It can process structured and unstructured data from various sources like text, images, videos, and logs.
- **High Throughput:** Hadoopâ€™s distributed storage model provides high throughput access to application data, which is ideal for processing large data sets.

### Installation and Configuration Overview

This guide covers the installation and configuration of Hadoop on Ubuntu, including setting up the Hadoop environment, configuring the necessary XML files, and running Hadoop services. 

**Note:** For detailed instructions, refer to the PDF file included in this repository.

### Practical Use Cases of Hadoop

- **Data Warehousing:** Integrating and analyzing large volumes of structured and unstructured data.
- **Log Processing:** Analyzing logs generated by systems or applications to monitor performance or detect issues.
- **Machine Learning:** Training machine learning models on large data sets.
- **Network Monitoring:** Monitoring and analyzing network traffic in real-time.
- **Social Media Analysis:** Analyzing data from social media platforms to understand trends and patterns.
